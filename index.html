    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I've recently graduated from UC Davis with a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. I am 
        interested in a career in software engineering and development. During college, I was involved in both 
        a smart IoT coffee machine and a web fitness tracker project where I developed skills in iOS 
        development, C, C++, Python, Arduino, AWS, full-stack web development, and problem-solving. I've 
        also developed soft skills like effective communication, particularly in communicating technical ideas 
        to technical and non-technical people by conducting presentations, live demos, and videos to the UC 
        Davis engineering professors and UC Davis general student body. In addition, I have developed soft 
        skills in customer service, teamwork, team building, and leadership as a Resident Advisor during my 
        college years. I'd love to learn more about opportunities in software engineering and development. 
        Please feel free to reach out to me about any entry-level software engineering positions you have.
